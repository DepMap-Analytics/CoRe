    "# CoRe package benchmarking\n",
    "This notebook contains the code for benchmarking core-fitness and common-essential genes (CFGs and CEGs) identified by the [CoRe R package](https://github.com/DepMap-Analytics/CoRe), respectively via the Adaptive Daisy Model (ADaM) and the Fitness Percentile (FiPer) method, against state-of-the-art sets of CFGs [1,2] and a logistic regression based method recently proposed in [3].<br>\n",
    "All the tested methods are executed on the largest integrative dataset of cancer dependencies assembled to date and presented in [4]. This encompasses data from large scale CRISPR-Cas9 screens performed at the Wellcome Sanger Institute [5] (release 1) and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard ([DepMap.org](https://depmap.org/), Release 20Q2) across hundreds of human cancer cell lines from multiple tissues/cancer-types.<br>\n",
    "This combined dataset is available at https://depmap.org/broad-sanger/ in two different versions resulting from two different preprocessing methods, respectively CERES [6] and CRISPRcleanR [7].<br>\n",
    "As demonstrated in [4], the CERES processed version is more suited for the identification of CFGs, thus this version is used here. This dataset is also scaled as described in [6] using reference sets of prior known essential/non-essential genes [1] (manually curated as described in [5]), prior the execution of each tested method.\n",

    "\n",
    "A baseline predictor is defined by considering CF genes those essential in at least n cell lines for all n. We compute the recall of this predictor using independent sets of a priori known essential genes (i.e. those involved in housekeeping cellular processes like translation or replication) [1-2]. <br>\n",
    "In addition, gene dependencies associated with a biomarker are very specific to the molecular context, therefore, these genes classified as CF are deemed false positives (FP). In the FP set are included also the non-expressed genes. We compute the recall of these FP genes for the baseline predictor.\n",
