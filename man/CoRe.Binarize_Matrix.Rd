\arguments{
\item{depMat}{Quantitative Dependency Matrix containing Pan-cancer or tissue/cancer-types specific gene fitness/dependency scores across cell-lines/samples. The value in position \eqn{[i,j]} of such matrix quantifies the fitness/dependency score of the \eqn{i}-th gene in the \eqn{j}-th cell line.}
\item{method}{A character string indicating which method is to be used for the computation of the binary matrix. One of "fdr" or "thr".\cr
  - fdr: For every cell line, the function computes the threshold at fixed FDR computed on the two distributions derived from sets of reference essential and non-essential genes. Genes with a logFC score less than the FDR threshold will be converted to 1, 0 otherwise. Different percentages of FDR can be specified by the user, according to the level of stringency (default is 0.05).\cr
  - thr: For every cell line, any gene with a logFC score less than \code{threshold} will be converted to 1, 0 otherwise.\cr}
\item{ess_genes}{Vector of gene symbols to be used as reference essential genes. Ignored if \code{scaled} is set to FALSE.}
\item{noness_genes}{Vector of gene symbols to be used as reference non-essential genes. Ignored if \code{scaled} is set to FALSE.}
\item{scaled}{Boolean, default is FALSE. Should the Quantitative Dependency matrix be scaled using reference set of essential and non essential genes (provided in input), as detailed in [2]. We always recommend scaling as a normalization procedure.}
\item{Bayes_Factor}{Boolean, default is FALSE. It indicates whether the Quantitative Dependency matrix was obtained from BAGEL2 [3].}
\item{FDRth}{a numerical value > 0 and < 1 specifying the false discovery rate threshold at which the matrix binarization will be computed, using two reference sets of essential and non-essential genes.}
\item{threshold}{default is NULL. A numerical value specifying a hard logFC score threshold. For every cell line, any gene with a logFC score less than \code{threshold} will be converted to 1, 0 otherwise. Scaling is warmly recommended for this method, in order to normalize essentiality profiles across cell lines.}
}
\value{
A binarized version of the Dependency Matrix where rows are genes and columns are cell lines. The entry in position [i,j] indicates whether the i-th gene is essential for the viability of the j-th cell line.
