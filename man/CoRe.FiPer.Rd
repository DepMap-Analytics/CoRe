\item{depMat}{Quantitative Dependency Matrix containing Pan-cancer or tissue/cancer-types specific gene fitness/dependency scores across cell-lines/samples. The value in position \eqn{[i,j]} of such matrix quantifies the fitness/dependency score of the \eqn{i}-th gene in the \eqn{j}-th cell line.}
\item{display}{Boolean, default is TRUE. Should gene score rank distributions of dependency scores be plotted.}
\item{percentile}{Numerical value in range [0,1], default is 0.9. Percentile to be used as a threshold.}
\item{method}{Character, default is 'fixed'. This parameter specifies which variant of the Fitness Percentile method should be used. Admissimble values are:\cr
  - fixed: a distribution of gene fitness-rank-positions in their most dependent \code{n}-th (determined by the \code{percentile} parameter) percentile cell line is used in the subsequent step of the Fitness Percentile method.\cr
  - average: a distribution of gene average fitness-rank-position across all cell lines at or over the \code{n}-th percentile of most dependent cell lines (where \eqn{n} is determined by the \code{percentile} parameter) is used in the subsequent step of the Fitness Percentile method.\cr
  - slope: for each gene, a linear model is fit on the sequence of gene fitness-rank-positions across all cell lines sorted according to their dependency on that gene, then a distrubution of models' slopes is used in the subsequent step of the Fitness Percentile method.\cr
  - AUC: for each gene, the area under the curve resulting from considering the sequence of gene fitness-rank-positions across all cell lines sorted according to their dependency on that gene is used in the subsequent step of the Fitness Percentile method.\cr

\description{Fitness percentile method to identify common essential genes from the joint analysis of multiple gene dependency profiles.}
\details{
This function implements the Fitness Percentile method to estimate common essential genes from multiple gene dependency screens introduced in [1]. For each gene in the quantitative dependency matrix provided in input a score is computed using three possible variants of the method. This can ben its fitness/essentiality rank when considering all gene essentiality scores in its \code{n}-th percentile least dependent cell line, or the average rank when considering all cell lines falling within or over the
\code{n}-th percentile of least dependent cell lines, or the slope of the curve obtained when fitting a linear model on the sequence of fitness-rank-positions across cell lines sorted according to the dependency on that gene (where both variant and \code{n} are user defined.)

The density of these gene scores (generally bimodal) is then estimated using a Gaussian kernel and
the central point of minimum density is identified. Genes whose score falls
below the point of minimum density are classified as common essential.
This method is fully detailed in [1]. Observed histrogram, estimated density distributions and discriminative threshold are also plotted.
